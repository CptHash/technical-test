## Subjet:

Here is the test of truth üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è !

Build a small web page using only Vue/Angular/React.

The specifications are :

When the page loads, the user sees a colored square that is positioned randomly into the window.

When the user clicks on the square, this one splits into 4 squares, each one is the quarter of the size of the previous square and positioned randomly into the window. The 4 new smaller squares have different colors which are also picked randomly.

When the user clicks on a square, it splits again into 4 smaller ones with different colors and different positions (each square is independent).

Careful, squares should never fall out of the window. They should always fit entirely into the window.

To add more fun, the user can activate and deactivate a crazy mode by double clicking on the page. In the crazy mode, the squares change their position randomly every 2 seconds!
